# ClickPlay

## Description: 
**Everyone watches movies and shows alone along with other people. We all run into the same issue, never remembering what we have seen and/or liked/disliked. There are so many different media players/streaming services these days that our information is never in one place!**

**_THAT IS WHERE CLICK PLAY COMES IN HANDY!_**

**Click play is an app where all of your titles can be stored in one place. That way you will never forget if you've watched it or not. Just type in the movie title, along with a quick rating. Next time a friend or loved one asks, "Have you seen this before?" or "Do you have any suggestions for a good movie?", all you have to do is open up your app!**

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/graycek13/Final-App/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
